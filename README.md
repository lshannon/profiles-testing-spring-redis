# Sample Description

This sample is a Redis backed basic Spring Boot application that uses Spring Data Redis (Repositories) to perform CRUD operations and Spring MVC to exposes the data via REST endpoints.

For Redis this sample uses an Embedded Redis as the local/dev store and a Service broker provisioned Redis on Pivotal Web Services (PWS).
